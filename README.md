## Bootcamp GFT ChallengeOOP

1. Let's ABSTRACT the Bootcamp DOMAIN and MODEL its ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS
2. We will create the CLASSES: Bootcamp, Courses, Mentorships and Devs and we will list them
3. The Course, Mentorship and Devs CLASSES will also be MODELED, that is, we will create their ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS
4. To make the code more readable and easier to maintain, we will use some of the tools that the OBJECT ORIENTATION PARADIGM (OOP) offers us: ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM
5. And to represent CLASSES that were created and related, we will transform them into OBJECTS
